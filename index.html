    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Peter Cole</h2>
            <p>A student in Code Fellows 201, I recently left an electrician apprenticeship. 
                Having spent time working in retail, commercial painting and arborism, 
                I am looking to finally define a career.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I instruct and lead rock and glacier climbs with a local
                 mountaineering non-profit. I also play tuba and piano!
            </p>
